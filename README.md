I will practice DOM manipulation and events in JavaScript, as well as CSS while creating this project.
Upon loading, the webpage will ask the user for a numerical input with a maximum value of 100, and create a grid based on this number.
After the grid is created, the user can hover over the grid elements with the mouse to change their color.
